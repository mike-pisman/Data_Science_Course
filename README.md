# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
### University of Michigan

This is a Coursera Specialization that helped me gain new insights into your data. Learn how to apply data science methods and techniques, and acquire analysis skills. The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

This repository includes files from first 4 courses, like homework assignments, final projects, and notes I've completed along completing the courses. 

* Course 1 - Introduction to Data Science in Python
* Course 2 - Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
* Course 3 - Applied Machine Learning in Python
* Course 4 - Applied Text Mining in Python
